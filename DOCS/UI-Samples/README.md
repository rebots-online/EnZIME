### 🚀 Implementation & Integration Guide

The assets in this package are authored as high-fidelity "Standalone Components." They include all necessary CSS, HTML structure, and interactive logic within a single file.

#### 1. Quick Preview
Simply open any of the `.html` files in a modern web browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, or Edge) to view the component in its full, interactive state.

#### 2. Project Integration
To integrate these into an existing codebase (React, Vue, Svelte, or standard HTML):

*   **Styles (CSS)**: Extract the content inside the `<style>` tags. We recommend placing these in a dedicated component stylesheet or a scoped CSS module.
*   **Structure (HTML)**: Copy the HTML markup within the `<body>` tags (excluding the `<script>` blocks). 
*   **Behavior (JavaScript)**: Extract the logic from the `<script>` tags. Most generated scripts are designed to be "Init-on-Load." Ensure any referenced DOM selectors match your implementation.

#### 3. Assets & Dependencies
*   **Fonts**: Most artifacts utilize high-quality typography from **Google Fonts**. Check the `<head>` or `@import` rules in the CSS to see which fonts are required.
*   **Images**: Any images provided during generation are embedded as base64 URIs or referenced via high-performance CDNs.

### 🛠 Technical Specifications Reference

*   **Framework Architecture**: Vanilla HTML5, CSS3 (Modern features like Grid, Flexbox, and Custom Properties), and ES6+ JavaScript.
*   **Responsiveness**: Components are authored with a "Mobile-First" philosophy using fluid units (vw, vh, rem, %) and media queries.
*   **Styling Strategy**: Most artifacts utilize BEM-like class naming or utility-first patterns to ensure low specificity and easy theme-overriding.
*   **Key Variables**: Check the `:root` or top-level CSS classes for CSS Custom Properties (variables) defining the color palette, spacing, and border-radii.
